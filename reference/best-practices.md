# Carousel Design Best Practices

Load this file during Phase 3 (slide structuring) and Phase 4 (HTML generation). These are the composition techniques and layout variants that separate designed carousels from template carousels.

## Core Principles

### Spatial Tension Over Centered Symmetry
Push headlines to top-left or bottom-right. Anchor numbers to one side with context floating opposite. Give the eye somewhere to travel. Centered-everything is the default, and defaults are invisible in a feed.

### Scale Contrast
Pair 160px numbers next to 24px labels. 80px headlines above 20px metadata. A 6:1 size ratio between the biggest and smallest text creates instant hierarchy without any other design elements. The contrast itself is the design.

### Layered Depth
Layer elements: semi-transparent shapes behind headlines, text overlapping colored bars, numbers sitting partially behind content cards. Achievable with z-index, negative margins, and opacity. Flat = forgettable.

### Negative Space as Design Element
Leave 30-40% of the slide as intentional empty space. Whitespace makes the remaining content feel more important. Don't fill available space just because it's there.

### Consistent but Varied
Same colors, fonts, and decorative motifs across all slides. But vary the spatial composition on every slide. Brand stays recognizable, layout stays fresh.

## Design Quality (Read This Before Generating Anything)

These principles separate carousels that look designed from carousels that look AI-generated. Every generation decision should pass through these filters.

### Structure Over Decoration
Use structural elements: rules (horizontal/vertical lines), grids, borders, strips, dividers. These create visual order. Avoid decorative filler: gradient blobs, radial glows, random shapes floating in corners. If a visual element doesn't organize information or reinforce the preset's concept, delete it.

**Structural (good):** A 1px vertical rule along the left edge. A 4px accent strip at the top that spans 30% of the width. A subtle dot grid as background texture. A thin border framing content.

**Decorative filler (bad):** A radial gradient blob in the corner "for visual interest." A random circle bleeding off the edge. A glowing accent shadow behind text. Multiple overlapping transparent shapes.

### Every Element Earns Its Place
Before adding any decorative element, ask: "What does this do?" Valid answers: creates structure, reinforces the preset concept, guides the eye, creates breathing room. Invalid answers: fills empty space, adds visual interest, makes it look designed.

Empty space is not a problem to solve. It's a design tool. A slide with a headline, a short rule, and 40% empty space looks more confident than a slide crammed with decorative elements.

### Presets Are Worlds, Not Color Schemes
Each preset has a concept. Terminal is a terminal. Blueprint is a technical drawing. Newsprint is a newspaper. The decorative elements, layout choices, and typography treatment should come from that world.

Terminal slides should feel like you're looking at a real terminal: window chrome, prompt symbols, status bars, line numbers. Not "dark background with green monospace text and a gradient blob."

Blueprint slides should feel like an engineering drawing: grid background, registration marks, annotation labels, dimension lines. Not "dark blue with cyan accents."

When generating, ask: "Would this element exist in the real-world version of this preset's concept?" If a terminal doesn't have gradient blobs, don't add them. If a newspaper doesn't have glowing text, don't add it.

### Avoid AI Default Patterns
Claude has specific visual habits that mark output as AI-generated. These are kill-on-sight:

- **Radial gradient blobs in corners.** The #1 AI tell. A soft colored circle fading to transparent, positioned in a corner "for depth." Delete it. Use structural elements (rules, borders, grids) instead.
- **Ghost text on every slide.** A giant faded word behind content works as a deliberate choice on 1-2 slides (like a slide number or section label). On every slide as default decoration, it's wallpaper.
- **Symmetrical vertical stacking.** Every slide: eyebrow top, headline middle, body below, metadata bottom, all centered. This is the default layout Claude reaches for. Actively break it. Push content to corners. Use asymmetric padding. Leave one entire half empty.
- **Accent glow effects.** text-shadow or box-shadow with spread in the accent color. Looks like a Figma tutorial, not real design. Use solid colors and hard edges.
- **Over-accented slides.** Accent eyebrow + accent headline + accent border + accent shape = nothing stands out. Max 3 accent elements per slide. Accent is a scalpel, not a paintbrush. Reserve accent for 5-10% of slide area, not 25-30%.
- **Identical spatial compositions.** If you squint and every slide has the same silhouette (text block in the middle, decoration in corners), the carousel fails. Each slide needs a different spatial weight distribution.
- **Decorative shapes with no concept tie.** Random circles, triangles, or abstract shapes that don't relate to the preset's world. If the preset is Terminal, decorative elements should feel like terminal UI. If it's Editorial, they should feel like newspaper layout elements.

## Visual Tricks (CSS-Implementable)

### Edge Bleed
Colored shapes positioned beyond slide boundaries, clipped by overflow:hidden. Creates the illusion of a larger design system. Implementation: absolute-positioned elements with negative margins or positions beyond 0/1080.

### Oversized Ghost Typography
A word or number at 200-400px, 5-15% opacity, positioned behind main content. Creates texture and depth. Implementation: absolute-positioned, high font-size, very low opacity, z-index below content.

### Color-Blocked Sections
Slide divided into 2-3 color zones (e.g., top 30% accent, bottom 70% background). Content sits across the boundary. Implementation: pseudo-element with position absolute covering a portion.

### Marker Highlight Effect
Key words get a background color (accent at 20-30% opacity). Implementation: `<span>` with background-color, padding: 4px 8px, box-decoration-break: clone.

### Pull-to-Next Continuity
Content that visually continues off the right edge, creating a swipe cue. Partial word, arrow, shape cut in half. Implementation: element at right edge, clipped by overflow:hidden.

### Stacked Cards with Offset
Content items as stacked cards with slight shadow or translate offset, implying depth. Implementation: box-shadow: 6px 6px 0 var(--surface) or transform: translateX(4px).

### Strategic Inversion
On one slide per carousel, invert the color scheme entirely. Accent bg + inverted text. The contrast against surrounding slides makes it impossible to scroll past.

### Opacity Layering
Instead of adding colors, use opacity variations: 100% for primary content, 60-70% for secondary, 15-25% for decorative, 5-10% for texture overlays. Keeps palette minimal while creating depth.

## Color Usage

**60-30-10 rule:** 60% background, 30% text/surface, 10% accent. This is the only color rule you need. Accent restraint details are in "Avoid AI Default Patterns" above.

---

## Typography Patterns

**Extreme weight contrast:** 900-weight headlines next to 300-weight body within the same family. The weight difference creates hierarchy without different colors or sizes.

**Monospace for data:** When mixing numbers and text, use monospace for numbers and sans-serif for narrative. The font switch signals "this is data."

**Size as structure:** In minimal styles, font size differences replace borders, cards, and backgrounds. A 160px number next to a 24px label needs no card.

---

## Layout Variants by Slide Type

For each type: multiple spatial compositions Claude can choose from. Pick the variant that best fits the content and creates rhythm contrast with adjacent slides.

### Hook / Opener

**Dominant flush-left:** Headline takes 60-70% of vertical space, left-aligned in upper-left. Eyebrow above. Massive negative space right and bottom. Accent bar (80px wide, 4px tall) below headline. Optional: large semi-transparent shape bleeding off bottom-right.

**Split-tone background:** Slide divided diagonally or horizontally into two color zones. Headline sits at the intersection of the two zones. Small badge/tag in corner ("FRAMEWORK" or "7 SLIDES"). Pseudo-element covers top portion with accent color.

**Ghost number overlay:** Single word or number at 300-400px, 8-12% opacity, center or off-center. Actual headline (48-64px) layered on top. Eyebrow label above.

**Full-bleed accent inversion:** Entire slide background is the accent color. All text inverted. Headline centered or bottom-aligned. Minimal: just hook text, nothing else. Optional noise texture at 3-5% opacity.

**Continuation fragment:** Headline intentionally incomplete, cuts off at right edge. Subtle arrow or "..." at right edge. Next slide completes the thought. Text uses white-space: nowrap, clipped by overflow:hidden.

### Data / Stats

**Hero number with context strip:** One number at 140-160px, upper-left or center. Single context sentence below (28-32px). Thin accent divider. Small source citation below divider.

**KPI dashboard grid:** 2x2 or 3x1 grid of data cards. Each card: small uppercase label, large accent number, delta indicator (arrow + percentage in green/red). Cards separated by 1px borders (gap trick: parent bg shows through).

**Before/after inline:** Two numbers side by side connected by arrow. Left number: line-through, opacity 0.4, muted. Right number: large, accent-colored. Context below. Eyebrow above.

**Vertical progress stack:** 3-4 metrics stacked vertically. Label left, thin progress bar middle, bold percentage right. Grid: 180px 1fr 80px. Progress bars 6-8px tall, accent fill.

**Radial donut with center callout:** Donut chart (conic-gradient) centered. Center hole has key number (56-72px) and one-word label. Legend below with 2-4 items. Circle focal point contrasts with rectilinear slide.

### Content / Teaching

**Numbered card stack:** 3-4 items in surface-bg cards, arranged vertically. Each card: large number (36-48px, accent) on left, point text on right. Optional slight transform offset on even cards. No headline needed, numbers create structure.

**Icon grid (2x2):** Four tiles in grid. Each: CSS icon/emoji (36-40px) at top, bold label (28-32px), one-line description (22-26px, muted). Surface background tiles.

**Left-border accent blocks:** 3-4 blocks stacked, each with thick left border (4-6px accent). Bold key phrase (32-36px) + supporting sentence (24-28px). No headline. First block serves as lead.

**Single point, full emphasis:** One teaching point gets the entire slide. Headline top third. Bold statement (36-40px) centered vertically. Supporting sentence below, muted. Accent underline on the statement.

**Alternating alignment:** 3 points alternating left and right alignment. Each with step number in opposing margin. Different accent treatments per point (dot, underline, highlight). Creates zig-zag reading pattern.

### Quote

**Oversized quote mark:** Massive decorative " at 280px, accent at 15-25% opacity, top-left. Quote text (36-44px, italic) offset below and right, clearing the mark. Attribution right-aligned below.

**Full-width left border:** 8-12px accent bar on entire left edge. Quote left-aligned against it with generous padding-left. Thin rule separating quote from attribution. Optional tag in bottom-right corner.

**Framed box:** Quote inside a 2-3px bordered rectangle centered on slide. 60-80px internal padding. Frame takes 60-70% of slide area. Attribution outside the frame below.

**Dark inversion panel:** 70% panel centered with inverted colors. Quote in contrasting color inside. Attribution outside panel in original colors.

**Scattered typography:** Quote broken across 2-3 lines with varying font sizes (48px, 36px, 44px). Key word in accent color. No quotation marks. Attribution with horizontal rule extending left.

### Comparison

**Diagonal split:** Slide divided diagonally via clip-path. Left/top zone one color, right/bottom another. "Before" items left, "After" items right. Central "vs" badge.

**Stacked with visual weight:** "Before" on top (smaller text, muted, line-through). "After" on bottom (larger text, full color, accent borders, check marks). Weight difference tells the story instantly.

**Strong central divider:** Two columns with 4-6px accent vertical divider (grid-template-columns: 1fr 6px 1fr). Color-coded header badges (red "Don't", green "Do").

**Paired slides:** Two consecutive slides instead of one. First slide: "The Old Way" with muted/red treatment. Second: "The New Way" with accent/green. Same layout, different styling. Full width for each side.

**Scorecard table:** Grid with criteria left column, checkmarks/x-marks in right columns. Alternating row backgrounds. Check marks in accent, x-marks in muted/red.

### Code / Technical

**IDE window:** Mock IDE with title bar (three dots, filename), dark code area below. Syntax highlighting via colored spans. Line numbers in muted left margin. Headline above the window.

**Terminal / CLI:** Full-slide terminal black. Prompt symbol ($ or >) in accent. Command text in text-primary. Output indented in text-secondary. Optional blinking cursor block. Comments in dim italic.

**Annotated snippet:** Code block takes left 60%. Right 40% has 2-3 annotation cards (surface bg, accent left-border) connected to specific lines. Each annotation: 2-3 words explaining the line.

**Diff before/after:** Two code blocks stacked or side by side. Removed lines: red-highlighted bg (rgba(248,81,73,0.15)), red left border, "-" prefix. Added lines: green-highlighted bg (rgba(46,160,67,0.15)), green left border, "+" prefix.

**Code + output split:** Top half: code/command. Bottom half: result/output. Thin divider with "OUTPUT" label between. Different visual treatment per section (lighter bg for output).

### CTA / Closer

**Generous space:** Top 60% empty (just background + preset decorations). Bottom 40%: prompt sentence (28px muted), main CTA (48-56px accent), tagline (24px muted). Center-aligned. justify-content: flex-end.

**Summary + CTA split:** Left/top half: 2-3 line summary of carousel thesis. Right/bottom half: handle + follow prompt. Divider between. Summary in text-secondary, CTA in accent.

**Profile card:** Centered card with profile circle (80-100px, accent border), name, handle, one-line description. Below card: follow prompt. Card floats with shadow or border.

**Reprise/callback:** Mirrors hook slide layout but with CTA content. Same spatial composition, same decorative elements, different text. Creates visual bookend.

**Minimal brand:** Just handle in large display text (56-64px accent), centered. Action word below ("Follow" or "Save this"). Preset decorations carry the visual weight.

### Story / Narrative

**Cascading text sizes:** Three text blocks decreasing: lead (40-44px, bold), body (28-32px, regular), aside (22-24px, italic, opacity 0.6). No headline. The lead IS the headline.

**Pull quote sandwich:** Key sentence "pulled out" large (44-52px) at top in accent. Context paragraph (28px) below. "So what" closer (30px, text-primary) at bottom.

**Dialogue format:** Lines alternate left and right aligned, like chat. Each line: padded, surface bg, rounded corners. Right-aligned lines use accent bg with inverted text. Container: flex-column with gap.

**First-word emphasis:** Single paragraph, but first word of each sentence is larger (36px), accent color, bold. Rest of sentence normal. Creates scanability within prose.

**Timeline narrative:** 3-4 temporal beats with time markers ("2019", "Day 1", "Now") on left in small uppercase. Narrative text to right. Thin vertical line connecting markers.

## Visual Rhythm Rules

### Pacing Principle
Think of a carousel like a song. Verses = content/teaching slides. Chorus = big statement or pull quote (reinforces theme). Bridge = data or comparison slide (changes energy).

### Rhythm Patterns

**Teach:** HOOK → BIG STATEMENT → CONTENT → SPLIT → CONTENT → BIG NUMBER → CONTENT → QUOTE → CTA

**Story:** HOOK → STORY → BIG NUMBER → STORY → COMPARISON → BIG STATEMENT → CTA

**Data:** HOOK → STATS → CONTENT → CHART BAR → STORY → BIG STATEMENT → CTA

**Contrarian:** HOOK → BIG STATEMENT → CONTENT → CODE/SPLIT → CONTENT → QUOTE → BIG STATEMENT → CTA

### Adjacency Rules
- Never two slides of the same type adjacent
- Never two text-heavy types adjacent (Content next to Story, Story next to Quote)
- After two information-dense slides, insert a breathing slide (Big Statement, Big Number, Quote)
- Hook and CTA should be the most visually distinct slides
- 8+ slide carousels need at least one data visualization

---

## Anti-Patterns

Check every slide against this list before finalizing. If any slide triggers 2+ of these, redesign it. For AI-specific visual tells, see "Avoid AI Default Patterns" in the Design Quality section above.

### Design

- No decorative images or illustrations. Typography, color, and CSS shapes only.
- No tiny text. If tempted to shrink to fit, split into another slide.
- No walls of text. Max 40 words per slide.
- No "safe" color distribution. Accent should be 5-10% of slide area, not 25-30%.
- No centered-everything layouts unless the preset specifically calls for it (e.g., Swiss Grid).

### Content

- No filler slides. "Let's dive in" is not a slide.
- No recap slides. The carousel IS the recap.
- No "follow for part 2" clickbait. Deliver full value. CTA is earned.
- No slide that exists only because "we need 10 slides." Every slide earns its spot or gets cut.

### Technical

- No inline images from URLs. Fonts from CDN are fine.
- No JavaScript. CSS only for all visual effects.
- No responsive design. Fixed 1080x1080. No media queries.
